# Unity AC

## What is this?

No this isn't a Unity Anti Cheat, instead it is a work in progress Unity reimplementation of Assault Cube. For our courses we needed engine-specefic games for some of the chapters and we didn't want any trouble with game publishers so we simply decided we'd make our owns. We picked Assault Cube simply because the game is free and open source. Because its license also states it shouldn't be used for commercial purposes this project will also remain free, open source and credit the authors of its assets. We don't plan on sticking to this forever it really is just a quick solution for us, but if you'd like to contribute you're free to do so.

## A word on licensing

We did our best to credit all of the original authors of any assets used although the crediting and licensing work on Assault Cube was very poorly done. In many cases such as for audios a lot of the assets used by the game are uncredited and sometimes unmodified samples from free sources. With this in mind you can find more details inside of the `LICENSE.md` file.
